# Penguins - The Friendship App

## Overview

 **Penguins** is an app that enables users to store and share cherished memories with friends, including how they met, first impressions, and common interests. It also allows users to keep in touch by writing letters. This app is particularly useful for friends who no longer live in the same city.

### Problem

Current social media platforms are primarily focused on individual self-presentation, often portraying an idealized version of one's life rather than emphasizing the importance of relationships. **Penguins** addresses this gap by linking shared memories directly to friendships, making them visible only to the involved friend. The goal is to create a space where users can truly cherish and nurture their relationships with different friends.

### User Profile

- People who want to keep in contact with friends they don't see regularly, e.g., because they live in a different city or country.
- People who want to have a dedicated space for showing their cherished friendships.
- People who value privacy and prefer sharing personal memories in a more intimate setting.
